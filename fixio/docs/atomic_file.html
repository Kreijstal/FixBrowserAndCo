<h2>AtomicFile class</h2>

<p>
AtomicFile provides a way to do atomic updates of files using transactions. The
class is designed as a layer on top of the regular <a href="file.html">File</a>.
It is designed for creation of various custom file formats, the only requirement
is that there are 32 bytes reserved somewhere in the file format header.
</p>

<p>
Concurrent access is supported (either in read only mode where multiple readers
can use the file at once, or a single writer). This is achieved using the file
locks and works between different processes and (if the OS implementation is not
faulty) over network file systems too.
</p>

<p>
The maximum file size is based on the page size. In the default setting the
limit is 16TB (4KB * 2<sup>32</sup>).
</p>

<p>
It is recommended to use the <a href="transaction.html"><code>transaction</code></a>
statement when working with the transactions.
</p>

<h3>Resiliency against failures</h3>

<p>
The implementation assumes that the file system (and the underlying layers and
the hardware) is competent enough to not put garbage data into the file after
synchronization and that the synchronization to the disk is guaranteed (it is
actually written to the disk before it returns success). Therefore the
implementation guards mainly against the partial writes (at byte granulity in
any order or portions). The format uses CRC-32 checksum to detect corruption in
the rollback.
</p>

<h3>Rollback</h3>

<p>
The rollback is appended at the end of the file (with a hole between the
original file size and the rollback to allow growth) and contains the original
content of pages. If the file resizes into the rollback or beyond, the rollback
is atomically moved to the new end of the file, increasing a hole between the
new file size and the new rollback to allow more growth without moving the
rollback again.
</p>

<p>
When there is a crash during the transaction the rollback is applied and
the modified data is rewritten with its original content. After the rollback is
applied the file is shrunk to remove the rollback. If there is a crash during
applying of the rollback there is no problem, the process will repeat with the
same result.
</p>

<p>
The rollback may contain duplicate pages, this is a result of using nested
transactions. However only the first encounter of each page is restored
on recovery. Each original content of the page is written first then commited
into the rollback. When multiple pages are written at once, all pages except
the first are pre-committed as the recovery will stop at any uncommited or
partial page (eg. when the file was shrunk to remove the rollback but before
the rollback was fully deactivated).
</p>

<h3 id="constants">Constants</h3>

<dl>
	<dt><code><b>ATOMIC_FILE_HEADER_SIZE</b> = 32</code></dt>
	<dd>
		This is the size of the required header and is always 32 bytes.
	</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="init">Initialization</h3>

<dl>
	<dt><code>
		static function <b>open</b>(file: <a href="file.html">File</a>, header_offset: Integer): AtomicFile<br>
		static function <b>open</b>(file: <a href="file.html">File</a>, header_offset: Integer, page_size: Integer): AtomicFile<br>
	</code></dt>
	<dd>
		Creates a new instance of the atomic file with a given physical file. The header
		offset must be always the same for the same file. Page size must be power
		of two (the default value is 4096). The file is brought into a clean state
		(rollback applied if present, the header written if the file is empty).
		The page size can be changed to a different value (for example to use smaller
		page when a lot of small changes are made, or bigger for big continuous
		overwrites). Beware of the maximum file size when using smaller page sizes.
	</dd>
	<dt><code>function <b>close</b>()</code></dt>
	<dd>
		Closes the file, rollbacks any uncommited transactions.
	</dd>
	<dt><code>function <b>register_cache_handler</b>(flush_func, discard_func, data)</code></dt>
	<dd>
		Registers a cache handler. The flush function is called whenever unwritten
		data needs to be written (before entering a nested transaction and before the
		outmost commit) and the discard function is called whenever both the cached
		and unwritten data (if it wasn't flushed) needs to be discarded (after the
		outmost transaction and before rollback for write transactions). Both functions
		take a single common parameter (data). The handlers are called in the opposite
		order than they were registered allowing to update the cached data from higher
		to lower abstraction layers.
	</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="transaction">Transaction functions</h3>

<dl>
	<dt><code>
		function <b>begin</b>()<br>
		function <b>begin</b>(write: Boolean)<br>
		function <b>begin</b>(write: Boolean, timeout: Integer): Boolean<br>
	</code></dt>
	<dd>
		Begins a new transaction. You can specify if it's read or write transaction
		(the default is write). You can use nested transactions, however you can't
		upgrade from a read transaction to a write transaction. If you need this to
		preprocess some data while allowing a concurrent read access, do it in the
		read transaction then commit it and begin a new write transaction, verify that
		the file wasn't changed in an incompatible way (in such case just reprocess
		the data again) and then you can write the results.
	</dd>
	<dt><code>function <b>commit</b>()</code></dt>
	<dd>
		Commits the transaction, making the changes permanent. This is required
		to be called even for read transactions.
	</dd>
	<dt><code>function <b>rollback</b>()</code></dt>
	<dd>
		Rollbacks the transaction, clearing any changes made in the transaction.
	</dd>
	<dt><code>function <b>in_transaction</b>(): Boolean</code></dt>
	<dd>
		Returns true when there is an active transaction.
	</dd>
	<dt><code>function <b>in_write_transaction</b>(): Boolean</code></dt>
	<dd>
		Returns true when there is an active write transaction.
	</dd>
	<dt><code>function <b>set_on_rollback</b>(container, key, value)</code></dt>
	<dd>
		Sets the original value in a container (array or hash) with a given key
		(or index) on rollback. In case of an array the key can be <code>-1</code>
		to set the length of the array. For hash tables, if the value is <code>null</code>
		the entry is removed. This function is provided to allow to reverse changes
		to the in-memory structures related to the transaction.
	</dd>
	<dt><code>function <b>call_on_rollback</b>(func, data, param)</code></dt>
	<dd>
		In case the <code>set_on_rollback</code> function is insufficient, you can
		register a call of a two parameter function (data is the first argument, and
		the param is the second) on rollback.
	</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="data">Data access functions</h3>

<dl>
	<dt><code>
		function <b>read</b>(offset: <a href="util/long.html">Long</a>, buf: Byte[])<br>
		function <b>read</b>(offset: <a href="util/long.html">Long</a>, buf: Byte[], off: Integer, len: Integer)<br>
	</code></dt>
	<dd>
		Reads a portion of the file at a given offset. Reading past the file length
		is an error.
	</dd>
	<dt><code>
		function <b>write</b>(offset: <a href="util/long.html">Long</a>, buf: Byte[])<br>
		function <b>write</b>(offset: <a href="util/long.html">Long</a>, buf: Byte[], off: Integer, len: Integer)<br>
	</code></dt>
	<dd>
		Writes a buffer (or it's portion) to the file at a given offset. Writing past
		the file length will enlarge the file (zero length will trigger this too).
	</dd>
	<dt><code>function <b>get_length</b>(): <a href="util/long.html">Long</a></code></dt>
	<dd>
		Returns the (logical) length of the file.
	</dd>
	<dt><code>function <b>set_length</b>(new_size: <a href="util/long.html">Long</a>)</code></dt>
	<dd>
		Sets a new length of the file. The file cannot be made smaller than the header.
	</dd>
